# Lab 8
## Alternative Query Expansion with GPT-2

In this notebook we will follow the same strategy as the previous lab, but using GPT-2 which is an enourmous pre-trained transformer model from HuggingFace.

We **could** get the embedding matrix from GPT-2 and fine tune an RNN with our training corpus instead of using it as is, but I thought it would be a nice exercise as we have already seen that working in lab 2

Run `jupyter notebook` and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
