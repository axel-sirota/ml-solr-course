## Alternative Query Expansion with RNNs

In this notebook we will use the text generation model we trained to expand the queries by generating alternate queries which are most likely to be similar to the query and to find more results in Solr.

This idea is the basis of creating multiple queries under the hood to increase recall intelligently without expecting the user to know how to interact with search engines.
1- cd into the base of the repo
2- Run `jupyter notebook` from there (**not** the exercise folder of the lab!) and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
