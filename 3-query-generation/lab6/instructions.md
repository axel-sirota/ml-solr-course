# Lab 6
## Text Generation with RNN/GRU

In this notebook we will train from scratch in an unsupervised fashion text generation to replicate the descriptions of the Airbnbn rentals. For time limitations it will not be the best model but it is structured in a portable fashion to your needs.


Take it easy and pay attention to the model, how we pass states, and the complexities to do the passthrough of passing the states character by character.

1- cd into the base of the repo
2- Run `jupyter notebook` from there (**not** the exercise folder of the lab!) and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
