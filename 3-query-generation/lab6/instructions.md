# Lab 4
## Distributed Memory Bag of Words (DBOW)

In this notebook we will train from scratch a DBOW document embedding model based Airbnb rental descriptions on various main cities of the world (135000 listings).

Take it easy and pay attention to the model, how easy it is to define it, and how easy it is to define Doc2Vec in gensim (which adds a layer over Keras).

Run `jupyter notebook` and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
