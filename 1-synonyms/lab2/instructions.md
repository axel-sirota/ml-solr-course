# Lab 2
## Using GloVe Embedding

In this notebook we will leverage Standford's GloVe vectors which is a pretrained embedding on 1.4B Tweets. 

Take it easy and pay attention to the main differences with before, and the non-trainable parameters. Finally, check how accurate the results now are.

1- cd into the base of the repo
2- Run `jupyter notebook` from there (**not** the exercise folder of the lab!) and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
