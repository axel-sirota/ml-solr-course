# Lab 3
## Synonym Expansion in Apache Solr

In this notebook we will wrap up what we have done in previous labs in the section by using the word embeddings we have trained.
With them, we will be able to use gensim to find the most_similar words to the ones queried (if a phrase you could do this on all nouns) and expand the query to cover all posible synonyms.

This method increases the recall of the retrieval system.

1- cd into the base of the repo
2- Run `jupyter notebook` from there (**not** the exercise folder of the lab!) and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
