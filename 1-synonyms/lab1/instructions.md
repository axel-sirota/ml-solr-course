# Lab 1
## Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)

In this notebook we will train from scratch a CBOW word embedding model based on a historic query log.
The query log is in the file `dataset/docv2_train_queries.csv` and it comes from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Text REtrieval Conference (also known as TREC).

Take it easy and pay attention to the model, how easy it is to define it,and the iteration nuances on the dataset generation.

Run `jupyter notebook` and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
