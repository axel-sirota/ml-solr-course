# Lab 5
## Reranking Algorithm

In this notebook we will rerank the results we get from Solr based on the document embedding we trained in the previous lab.

Run `jupyter notebook` and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
