# Lab 5
## Reranking Algorithm

In this notebook we will rerank the results we get from Solr based on the document embedding we trained in the previous lab.


1- cd into the base of the repo
2- Run `jupyter notebook` from there (**not** the exercise folder of the lab!) and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
