# Bonus Lab: Learning to Rank 
## RankNet

In this notebook we will train on random data the learning to rank model RankNet.

The idea behind LTR is always to start with a dataset of some queries, their returned documents and the score of relevance. This relevance may be an *a posteriori* metric like number of clicks.

1- cd into the base of the repo
2- Run `jupyter notebook` from there (**not** the exercise folder of the lab!) and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
