# Bonus Lab: Bidirectional LSTM for sentiment analysis
## RankNet

In this notebook we will train a Bi-LSTM on IMDB reviews to find if those are positive or negative reviews

1- cd into the base of the repo
2- Run `jupyter notebook` from there (**not** the exercise folder of the lab!) and access the notebook in this lab, under `exercise`. Follow the instructions. Good luck!

Note: You can always check at the solutions!
